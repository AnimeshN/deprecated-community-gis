      <p>CommunityGIS is a platform for community for a spatial data infrastructure. This consists of
        frontend described below and backend which is geonode <a href="https://geonode.org">(visit)</a>.Primary
        objective of communitygis is to provide educational platform for learners to learn about spatial
        information and learn how these modern tools can be used to solve real life problems. As a
        platform it is for people who range from those who can contribute data (mobile based point data
        collection to digitization of published maps) to those who can analyse the data to infer useful
        social knowledge. It is a digital way to collect, aggregate , access , analyse data and finally
        provide decision support to the community manipulate reality. Since all source code is
